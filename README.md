Hackathon Case Study: Personal Health & Wellness Aggregator

Problem Statement: Health-conscious individuals are often drowning in data from a
multitude of disconnected sources—a wearable tracking sleep, an app for logging nutrition, a
smart scale for weight, and a blood pressure monitor. This data fragmentation makes it nearly
impossible to see the bigger picture and understand the complex interplay between diet,
exercise, sleep, and overall well-being.

Your Challenge: Build an intelligent platform that unifies disparate health data streams to
provide a single, holistic view of a user's wellness, transforming raw numbers into actionable,
personalized insights.

Target Audience:
- Fitness enthusiasts who want to optimize their training and recovery by understanding
how sleep and nutrition impact performance.
- Health-conscious individuals seeking to make informed lifestyle choices based on their
own data.
- People managing chronic conditions who need to track multiple health metrics and
understand their correlations.
